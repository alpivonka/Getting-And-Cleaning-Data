3) I have been writing code for over 14yrs and I have developed many habits, good and bad. One of those habits is line by line commenting of my code. Some don't like this because they feel it clutters the code with unneeded comments because they believe the code is self documenting. I do not agree, I believe we need to be able to not only write the code yet also articulate the code in the written word as well.

4) Based on #2 above I have chosen the “wide” approach since it allows for easier calculations of the data then does the “long” form. Yet with that in mind, I have also attempted the long approach as well to better understand how it is derived.  You will see two different output files, yet please only judge the code and it's output on the wide approach.
