# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data

**Please note:** 

1) This repository has limited checkins due to it is the final release and all subsequent checkins where performed with the following repository:
-- https://github.com/alpivonka/getdata-010_course_project

2) Please review the posting regarding Tidy Data "So what does this mean for the assignment?"
-- https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013/forum/thread?thread_id=31

3) I have been writing code for over 14yrs and I have developed many habits, good and bad. One of those habits is line by line commenting of my code. Some don't like this because they feel it clutters the code with unneeded comments because they believe the code is self documenting. I do not agree, I believe we need to be able to not only write the code yet also articulate the code in the written word as well.

4) Based on #2 above I have chosen the “wide” approach since it allows for easier calculations of the data then does the “long” form. Yet with that in mind, I have also attempted the long approach as well to better understand how it is derived.  You will see two different output files, yet please only judge the code and it's output on the wide approach. 

**Assumptions:**

1) The grader will not only pull down the code base here (run_analysis.R) yet will also obtain the "Dataset" as well as it contains the reference data needed and consumed by the "run_analysis.R" code.

**Instructions:**

“run_analysis.R” is the only “R” code needed and is dependent upon the following packages being installed:
<ol> 
<li>plyr</li>
<li>dplyr</li>
<li>tidyr</li>
<li>utils</li>
</ol>
